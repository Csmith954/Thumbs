# Thumbs Cipher

**Project Description:** Thumbs Cipher is a command-line interface (CLI) program that allows users to enter a message, which will then be encoded and returned to them. The cipher converts the user's text into a binary string representation. Each binary character (1 or 0) is then used to generate a corresponding thumbs-up emoji (üëç) or thumbs-down emoji (üëé).
